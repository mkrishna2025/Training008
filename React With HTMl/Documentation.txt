React - Independent library for developing user interfaces

ReactDOM - Web
ReactNative - Mobile


Libraries to Import
	React - React.createElement(type, attributes, innerhtml)
	ReactDOM - ReactDOM.render(what to render, where to render);

Adding Script to HTML
	In Header => loaded before body is rendered
	In Body => loaded after body is rendered
	

React.createElement('div', { id: 'div1', items: [ {}, {}]}, 'Welcome to Demo');
React.createElement('button', { id: ''}, 'Login')
React.createElement('textbox', { id: ''}, '')

JSX vs HTML

HTML => not  compiled
		pure html components
		

JSX => compiled
		jsx component => it will be converted into old format like (React.createElement), html components are generated dynamically
		
Important Points
	Use curly braces for variables with in jsx elements.

React Component => function(stateless), ES6 class(stateful)

ES6 React Component => Create a class and extend the React.Component class and implement the default method render for returning views.

By default, this is null with in any function of ES6 component, we need to use .bind(this) in order to pass the scope(this) to the function.

variables
block level => 
			variables created with in the function. 
			Cant access outside the function.
			var name, students;
public variables =>
			this.name
			this.students
			Can be created in any method and can be accessed in all methods of that class.
			
props =>
		this.props.name
		this.props.students
		there are variables that component receives
		this should not update 
		
state level =>
		this.state.name
		this.state.students
	
Assume we have keep a, b, c, d, e variables in state
	this.state = {
		a: 1,
		b: 2,
		c: 3,
		d: 4,
		e: 5
	}

Assume we need to update b to 10 and c to 20
	this.setState({ b: 10, c: 20});
	
As b and c values are changed, ui refreshes automatically with these values.

Assume we need to update b to 2 and c to 3
	this.setState( { b: 2, c: 3 } )
As b and c values are not changed, ui will not refresh...


this.state = {
	data: [
		{
			location: 'Hyderabad',
			temp: 20,
			humidity: 15
		},
		{
			location: 'Nellore',
			temp: 30,
			humidity: 15
		}
	]
}
// assume temperatures are updated to 40..

this.setState({
	data: [
		{
			location: 'Hyderabad',
			temp: 40,
			humidity: 15
		},
		{
			location: 'Nellore',
			temp: 40,
			humidity: 15
		}
	]
})

indexOf gives position/index of item
"Krishna".indexOf("K") => 0
"Krishna".indexOf("i") => 2
"Krishna".indexOf("india") => -1


block level => var name
public => this.name
state => this.state.name
props => this.props.name

setState
this.props.children => inner nodes
defaultProps => default attributes
