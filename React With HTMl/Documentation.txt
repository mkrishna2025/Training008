React - Independent library for developing user interfaces

ReactDOM - Web
ReactNative - Mobile


Libraries to Import
	React - React.createElement(type, attributes, innerhtml)
	ReactDOM - ReactDOM.render(what to render, where to render);

Adding Script to HTML
	In Header => loaded before body is rendered
	In Body => loaded after body is rendered
	

React.createElement('div', { id: 'div1', items: [ {}, {}]}, 'Welcome to Demo');
React.createElement('button', { id: ''}, 'Login')
React.createElement('textbox', { id: ''}, '')

JSX vs HTML

HTML => not  compiled
		pure html components
		

JSX => compiled
		jsx component => it will be converted into old format like (React.createElement), html components are generated dynamically
		
Important Points
	Use curly braces for variables with in jsx elements.
